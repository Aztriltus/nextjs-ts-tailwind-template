## Configurations done in this template 
- Absolute file referencing e.g. "@/modules/components/Hello.tsx" via tsconfig
- Modular file structure e.g."@/modules/common", "@/modules/ModuleName"
- Dynamic layout support for reusing layout component across pages without re-declaring on each page
- Using sass for tailwind config, and some boilerplate e.g. setting html, body elements, etc
- Sorted imports e.g. alphabetical and in groups. Avoids git diff changes when imports are sorted differently between people
- Requires vscode extensions like eslint and prettier
- Use ./src as src directory for nextjs 
- Includes a <meta> reusable component PageHead to use in each page and also some default favicons 

## Using the PageHead component
Use this component to quickly bootstrap the meta tags for the page
1. Go to PageHead component and update the `appName` const to your project's title
2. Use PageHead in your /pages/**/* files
3. Feel free to update the props as you see fit
