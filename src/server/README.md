## Server folder

This folder contains all the server actions that will be used in the app.

### How to organise this folder

The name of the file should be similar to the name of the page. For example, if you want to create a server action for a
page called `Dashboard`, the file should be called `dashboard.ts`. So that it is easy to find the actions for a specific
page.
