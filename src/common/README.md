## Common Folder

When you are going to share the any components or files across modules, create them here

**The following should go into the common folder as well:**

1. Any other files that don't belong in modules
1. Basic and common components
1. Common functions
1. Type files
1. React Hooks, Context, etc
1. Shared data, etc
1. Code related to external libraries

### Check subfolders for more README

Please only use the subfolders created. It'll be good to keep them even if they are empty so in the future, they could be useful
